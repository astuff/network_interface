2.1.0 (2018-08-30)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#13 <https://github.com/astuff/network_interface/issues/13>`_ from astuff/maint/remove_unused_variables_in_test
* Minor linting stuff.
* Implementing proper dependencies for rosunit.
* Removing unused variables in gtests.
* Merge pull request `#10 <https://github.com/astuff/network_interface/issues/10>`_ from astuff/maint/roslint
* Removing temporary .orig files.
* Fixing roslint suggestions.
* Adding roslint.

* endianess check now returns bool
* removes copying input into system endianess check
* Adds check for system endianess
  This allows moving the source address start further into
  the stored uint64_t to properly grab the least significant
  bytes for putting into smaller containers.

  Also adds .vscode to gitignore for VS Code users.
* Merge pull request `#6 <https://github.com/astuff/network_interface/issues/6>`_ from astuff/unit_testing
* Adds unit tests for some methods. Corrects found issues
  Unit tests found issues with misinterpreting floats and doubles
  Modified methods and now this commit Fixes `#1 <https://github.com/astuff/network_interface/issues/1>`_
* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/astuff/network_interface/issues/3>`_ from KyleARectorAStuff/feature/tcp_read_timeout
* Adding no-timeout option when the timeout_ms argument is 0
  Before this commit, a timeout was used in every call TCPInterface::read or
  TCPInterface::read_exactly, with a default of 0 ms. After this commit,
  the default is set to 0 ms, and if the read or read_exactly methods receive
  a 0 timeout request, it will not set a deadline for the timeout, resulting
  in a blocking read. This allows for the TCPInterface to behave with a
  timeout, or else be used as it was previously.
* Removing timeout/received flags, adding error checking in timeout handler
  Before this commit, the result of a read or timeout was stored in a private variable,
  populated by the respective callback. After this commit, the conditional statements that
  proviously relied on the flags instead rely on the gloabl error message's value.
  Additionally, the timeout handler has added error checking to prevent it from executing fully
  when the timer.cancel() method is called after a successful read.
* Adding TCP timout to TCPInterface::read_exactly function
  Before this commit, the read_exactly method used a blocking read call. After this commit, the
  read_exactly function has a configurable timeout in milliseconds, with a default of 5 ms.
* Parameterizing timeout value and setting default to 5 ms
  Before this commit, the timeout for the TCPInterface::read() method had a hard-coded timeout
  value of 5 ms. After this commit, the TCPInterface::read() function takes an optional
  parameter for the timeout, in milliseconds. This parameter defaults to 5 ms.
* Removing while loop with io_service\_.run_one() condition for correct execution
  Before this commit, the tcp_interface read method would constantly return a timeout error, even
  if data had been read properly. After this commit, the read method returns an OK status if the read
  was successful, or TIMEOUT or READ_FAILED depending on the failure type. In the Boost asio library,
  the io_service can be run continuously, or run once until an event hander has been dispatched. The
  return value of the run_one method was previously used as a while loop exit condition, but this
  resulted in the initial behavior describe above, as if the run_one method actually returned after
  several even handlers were dispatched, instead of just one. After removing the while loop and using
  the method alone, the desired behavior was achieved.
